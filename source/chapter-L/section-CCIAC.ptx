    <title>Conditionals, Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Many statements and theorems in mathematics are of the form <q>If <m>X</m> is true, then <m>Y</m> is true.</q>, called a <em>conditional</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conditionals are the basis for logical deduction, because we want to be able to make a conclusion based on known facts.

        <title>Conditional (Implication)</title>

        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>conditional</term> (or <term>implication</term>), denoted by <m>P \rightarrow Q</m>, is a statement that is true if <m>P</m> if false or if <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are true, and is false if <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            In mathematics, <m>P</m> is often called the <term>hypothesis</term> and <m>Q</m> is called the <term>conclusion</term>. In logic, <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are more typically called the <term>antecedent</term> and <term>consequent</term>, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is called a conditional because the truth of the conclusion <m>Q</m> is <em>conditional</em> on the truth of the hypothesis <m>P</m>. It is called an implication because the truth of <m>P</m> <em>implies</em> the truth of <m>Q</m>.
        </p>

        <example>
            <q>If what you've told me is true, [then] you will have gained my trust.</q> (Mace Windu).
        </example>
        <p>
            If a conditional is true, then the hypothesis <m>P</m> gives a condition (not necessarily the only condition) under which the conclusion <m>Q</m> will also be guaranteed to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the condition <m>P</m> is not met (i.e. is false), a conditional says nothing about the truth of the conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The truth table for a conditional is given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c|c|c}
                P \amp Q \amp P \rightarrow Q \\ \hline
                T \amp T \amp T \\ \hline
                T \amp F \amp F \\ \hline
                F \amp T \amp T \\ \hline
                F \amp F \amp T
            \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
            If a conditional statement is true simply because its hypothesis is false, it is said to be <term>vacuously true</term> (or, true by default).
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternative forms of the conditional include, <q>If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m></q>, <q><m>P</m> implies <m>Q</m></q>, <q><m>P</m> is a sufficient condition for <m>Q</m></q>, <q><m>P</m> only if <m>Q</m></q>, <q><m>Q</m> if <m>P</m></q>, and, <q><m>Q</m> is a necessary condition for <m>P</m></q>.

        <title>Logical Connectives as Operators</title>
        <p>
            These logical connectives can be thought of as operators that combine multiple statments and ouput another single statement. This is analogous to how <m>+</m> or <m>\times</m> combines two numbers and outputs a single number.

        <title>Converse</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>converse</term>, <m>Q \rightarrow P</m>, switches the hypothesis and conclusion.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
                P \amp Q \amp P \rightarrow Q \amp Q \rightarrow P \\ \hline
                T \amp T \amp T \amp T \\ \hline
                T \amp F \amp F \amp T \\ \hline

        </me>

        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>inverse</term>, <m>\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q</m>, negates the hypothesis and conclusion.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The truth table is given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
                P \amp Q \amp \neg P \amp \neg Q \amp P \rightarrow Q \amp \neg P \rightarrow \neg Q \\ \hline
                T \amp T \amp F \amp F \amp T \amp T \\ \hline
                T \amp F \amp F \amp T \amp F \amp T \\ \hline
                F \amp T \amp T \amp F \amp T \amp F \\ \hline
                F \amp F \amp T \amp T \amp T \amp T
            \end{array}

        <title>Contrapositive</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>contrapositive</term>, <m>\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P</m>, negates both statements, and reverses the order of the conditional.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            In short, the contrapositive is the converse of the inverse. It has truth table given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
                P \amp Q \amp \neg P \amp \neg Q \amp P \rightarrow Q \amp \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \\ \hline
                T \amp T \amp F \amp F \amp T \amp T \\ \hline
                T \amp F \amp F \amp T \amp F \amp F \\ \hline
                F \amp T \amp T \amp F \amp T \amp T \\ \hline
                F \amp F \amp T \amp T \amp T \amp T
            \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
            Notice that the truth values for the contrapositive <m>\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P</m> are the same as the original condition <m>P \rightarrow Q</m>.
