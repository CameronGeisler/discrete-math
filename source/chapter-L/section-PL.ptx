    <title>Predicate Logic</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Many statements in mathematics can't be modelled using propositional logic. In particular, statements that include words such as <q>all</q>, <q>some</q>, <q>no</q>, etc.

        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>predicate</term> is a sentence that includes variables, that becomes a statement when specific values are substituted for the variables.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            For example, equations involving variables, or inequalities, are predicates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Predicates are denoted by <m>P(x)</m>, where <m>P</m> represetns the predicate, and <m>x</m> is the variables. This is called a <term>propositional function</term>. Its input are the values of the variables, and its output is a truth value. For a specific value of <m>x</m>, <m>P(x)</m> becomes a statement which is either true or false.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <term>domain</term> of a propositional function is the set of all possible values that the input variable can take on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proportional functions can be combined with logical operators, such as negation, conjunction, disjunction, etc.
        </p>

        <definition>
            <p>
                Let <m>P(x)</m> be a predicate, where <m>x</m> has domain <m>D</m>. The <term>truth set</term> of <m>P(x)</m> is the set of all elements of <m>D</m> that make <m>P(x)</m> true when they are substituted for <m>x</m>. In other words, the set,
            </p>
            <me>
                \set{x \in D : P(x)}
            </me>
