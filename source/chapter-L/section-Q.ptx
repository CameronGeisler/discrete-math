    <title>Quantifiers</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Previously, propositional function could be converted to statements by substituting a particular value of all of their variables. A more useful way is to use <em>quantifiers</em>.

        <title>Quantifiers</title>

        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>existential quantifier</term>, denoted by <m>\exists</m>, is read as <q>there exists</q>, <q>there is a</q>, <q>there is at least one</q>, or <q>for some</q>.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Then,
        </p>

        <definition>
            <p>
                An <term>existential statement</term> is a statement of the form,
            </p>
            <me>
                \exists x \in D, P(x)
            </me>
            <p>
                which represents the statement, <q>there exists <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>P(x)</m> such that <m>P(x)</m> is true</q>. This statement is true if (and only if) there is at least one <m>x \in D</m> such that <m>P(x)</m> is true.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>universal quantifier</term>, <m>\forall</m>, is read as <q>for all</q>, <q>for every</q>, <q>for any</q>, or <q>for each</q>.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Then,
        </p>

        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>universal statement</term> is a statement of the form,
            </p>
            <me>
                \forall x \in D, P(x)
            </me>
            <p>
                which represents the statement, <q>for all <m>x \in D</m>, <m>P(x)</m> is true</q>. This statement is true if (and only if) <m>P(x)</m> is true for all values of <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>P</m>.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Sometimes, if the domain <m>D</m> is implicit, we simply write, <m>\forall x, P(x)</m> and <m>\exists x, P(x)</m>.
        </p>

        <title>Using Quantifiers</title>

        <example>
            <p>
                <q>You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</q> This means that for all shots that you don't take, you will miss.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            To show that a existential statement is true, it is sufficient to provide a single example <m>x</m> that satisfies <m>P(x)</m>. To prove it is false requires proving that <m>P(x)</m> is false for all values of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To show that an universal statement is true, this requires proving that <m>P(x)</m> is true for all values of <m>x</m>. To prove it is false, it is sufficient to provide one example where it is false (called a <term>counterexample</term>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the domain of <m>P(x)</m> is finite, say <m>\set{x_1, \dots, x_n}</m>, then,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x \in D, P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \land \dots \land P(x_n) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \exists x \in D, P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \lor \dots \lor P(x_n)
        </me>
        <p>
            In this case, proving the universal statement can be reduced to showing that each of the statements <m>P(x_1), \dots, P(x_n)</m> is true (called the <term>method of exhaustion</term>). This brute force technique is particularly more applicable with the rise of computing power, allowing for a large numebr of calculations to be done in a shorter period of time. However, this method can't be used if the set is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
            This also makes it clear that <m>\forall x, P(x)</m> is a stronger statement than <m>\exists x, P(x)</m>. In other words,
        </p>
        <me>
            \brac{\forall x, P(x)} \rightarrow \brac{\exists x, P(x)}
        </me>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Uniquness Quantifier</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>uniqueness quantifier</term>, denoted by <m>\exists !</m>, represents <q>there exists a unique</q>, <q>there exists exactly one</q>.
            </p>
        </definition>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Quantifiers and Conditionals</title>
        <p>
            The statement, <m>\forall x \in S, P(x)</m> means that for all elements <m>x</m> in the set <m>S</m>, the statement <m>P(x)</m> is true. This is equivalent to saying that the conditional, <q>If <m>x</m> is <em>any</em> element of <m>S</m>, then <m>P(x)</m> is true</q>. In symbols, this can be summarized as,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x \in S, P(x) \equiv x \in S \rightarrow P(x)
        </me>
        <p>
            A statement of the form <m>x \in S \rightarrow P(x)</m> is said to be <term>implicit quantification</term>.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Negating Quantifiers (De Morgan's Laws)</title>
        <p>
            Previously, we saw that the universal statement <m>\forall x, P(x)</m> is false if and only if there is at least one <m>x</m> such that <m>P(x)</m> is false. Analogously, the existential statement <m>\exists x, P(x)</m> is false if and only if <m>P(x)</m> is false for every value of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Roughly, this shows that the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement, and the negation of an existential statement is a universal statement. In particular,
        </p>
        <fact>
            <title>Negation of quantified statements</title>
            <md>
                <mrow>\neg \brac{\forall x, P(x)} \amp \equiv \exists x, \neg P(x)</mrow>
                <mrow>\text{and} \qquad \neg \brac{\exists x, P(x)} \equiv \forall x, \neg P(x)</mrow>
            </md>
        </fact>
        <p>
            Intuitively, this means that to negate a quantified statement, <q>negate</q> both parts, i.e. flip <m>\forall</m> to <m>\exists</m> and vise versa, and negate the statement <m>P(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This duality between universal and existental statements, are analogous to de Morgan's laws, which show a duality between <q>or</q> and <q>and</q> statements. This similarity can be seen more precisely if the domain of <m>P(x)</m> is finite, say <m>\set{x_1, \dots, x_n}</m>. Then, recall that,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x \in D, P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \land \dots \land P(x_n) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \exists x \in D, P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \lor \dots \lor P(x_n)
        </me>
        <p>
            Then, by De Morgan's laws,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\neg \brac{\forall x \in D, P(x)} \amp \equiv \neg \brac{P(x_1) \land \dots \land P(x_n)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \equiv \neg P(x_1) \lor \dots \lor \neg P(x_n) \amp\amp \text{by De Morgan's laws}</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            and similarly,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\neg \brac{\exists x \in D, P(x)} \amp \equiv \neg \brac{P(x_1) \lor \dots \lor P(x_n)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \equiv \neg P(x_1) \land \dots \land \neg P(x_n) \amp\amp \text{by De Morgan's laws}</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            This reasoning only applies to finite sets, but the rules for negation of quantified statements applies to any domain set. In this sense, universal statements are a generalization of <q>and</q> statements, and existential statements are a generalization of <q>or</q> statements.

        <title>Universal Conditional Statements</title>
        <p>
            Sometimes, universal statements are false, but they are true if the domain <m>D</m> is restricted by some hypotheses <m>P(x)</m>. That is, if <m>P(x)</m> is satisfied, then the universal statement is true. This leads to the universal conditional.
        </p>

        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>universal conditional statement</term> is a statement of the form,
            </p>
            <me>
                \forall x \in D, \text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x) \qquad \text{or,} \qquad \forall x \in D, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)
            </me>
        </definition>

        <p>
            If <m>S</m> is defined to be the subset of <m>D</m> such that <m>P(x)</m> is true, then an equivalent statement is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x \in S, Q(x)
        </me>
        <p>
            In other words,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x \in D, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x) \equiv \forall x \in S, Q(x)

        <title>Negation of a Universal Conditional</title>
        <p>
            Recall that the negation of a universal statement <m>\forall x, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)</m>, is given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \neg \brac{\forall x, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)} \equiv \exists x \text{ such that } \neg (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))
        </me>
        <p>
            Then, recall that the negation of a conditional is given by
        </p>
        <me>
            \neg (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)) \equiv P(x) \land \neg Q(x)
        </me>
        <p>
            Then, putting things together,
        </p>
        <fact>
            <p>
                The negation of a universal conditional is,
            </p>
            <me>
                \boxed{\neg \brac{\forall x, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)} \equiv \exists x \text{ such that } P(x) \land \neg Q(x)}

            <p>
                A universal conditional <m>\forall x \in D, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)</m>, is said to be <term>vacuously true</term> (or <term>true by default</term>) if <m>P(x)</m> is false for every <m>x \in D</m>.

        <title>Nested Quantifiers</title>

        <p>
            With multiple quantifiers, we proceed from left to right.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <m>\exists x, \exists y, P(x,y)</m> means that there exists <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
            <li>
                <m>\forall x, \forall y, P(x,y)</m> means that for all <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <m>\forall x, \exists y, P(x,y)</m> means that for all <m>x</m>, there exists a <m>y</m> such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
            <li>
                <m>\exists x, \forall y, P(x,y)</m> means that there exists <m>x</m>, such that for all <m>y</m>, <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The first statement means that given a particular value of <m>x</m>, there exists a <m>y</m> (which can depend on <m>x</m>) such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true. In contrast, the second statement says that there exists a value of <m>x</m> (which is chosen first), such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true for all values of <m>y</m>. The difference is the order in which the variables are chosen. The second kind of mixed quantifiers is often a stronger statement.
        </p>

        <me>
            \neg \brac{\forall x, \exists y, P(x,y)} = \exists x, \forall y, \neg P(x,y)

            \neg \brac{\exists x, \forall y, P(x,y)} = \forall x, \exists y, P(x,y)
