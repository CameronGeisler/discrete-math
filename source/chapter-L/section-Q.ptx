            Propositional functions can be converted to statements using quantifiers.

        <title>Quantifiers</title>

        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>existential quantifier</term>, denoted by <m>\exists</m>, represents <q>there exists</q>, <q>there is a</q>, or <q>there is at least one</q>.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Then,
        </p>
        <me>
            \exists x, P(x)
        </me>
        <p>
            represents the statement, <q>there exists <m>x</m> such that <m>P(x)</m> is false</q>.
        </p>


        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>universal quantifier</term>, <m>\forall</m>, represents <q>for all</q>, <q>for every</q>, or <q>for each</q>.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Then,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x, P(x)
        </me>
        <p>
            represents the statement, <q>for all <m>x</m>, <m>P(x)</m> is true</q>. This means that <m>P(x)</m> is true for all values of <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>P</m>.
        </p>

        <title>Using Quantifiers</title>

        <example>
            <p>
                <q>You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</q> This means that for all shots that you don't take, you will miss.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            To show that a existential statement is true, it is sufficient to provide a single example <m>x</m> that satisfies <m>P(x)</m>. To prove it is false requires proving that <m>P(x)</m> is false for all values of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To show that an universal statement is true, this requires proving that <m>P(x)</m> is true for all values of <m>x</m>. To prove it is false, it is sufficient to provide one example where it is false (called a <term>counterexample</term>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the domain of <m>P(x)</m> is finite, say <m>\set{x_1, \dots, x_n}</m>, then,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x, P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \land \dots \land P(x_n) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \exists x, P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \lor \dots \lor P(x_n)
        </me>
        <p>
            In this case, proving the universal statement can be reduced to showing that each of the statements <m>P(x_1), \dots, P(x_n)</m> is true. However, this method can't be used if the set is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes it clear that <m>\forall x, P(x)</m> is a stronger statement than <m>\exists x, P(x)</m>. In other words,
        </p>
        <me>
            \brac{\forall x, P(x)} \rightarrow \brac{\exists x, P(x)}
        </me>
        <p>
            The statement, <m>\forall x \in S, P(x)</m> means that for all elements <m>x</m> in the set <m>S</m>, the statement <m>P(x)</m> is true. This is equivalent to saying that the conditional, <q>If <m>x \in S</m>, then <m>P(x)</m> is true</q>. In symbols, this can be summarized as,
        </p>
        <me>
            \forall x \in S, P(x) \equiv x \in S \rightarrow P(x)
        </me>

        <title>Uniquness Quantifier</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>uniqueness quantifier</term>, denoted by <m>\exists !</m>, represents <q>there exists a unique</q>, <q>there exists exactly one</q>.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <title>Negating Quantifiers (De Morgan's Laws)</title>
        <me>
            \neg \brac{\forall x, P(x)} \equiv \exists x, \neg P(x)
        </me>
        <me>
            \neg \brac{\exists x, P(x)} \equiv \forall x, \neg P(x)
        </me>
        <p>
            In other words, the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement, and the negation of an existential statement is a universal statement.

        <title>Nested Quantifiers</title>

        <p>
            With multiple quantifiers, we proceed from left to right.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <m>\exists x, \exists y, P(x,y)</m> means that there exists <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
            <li>
                <m>\forall x, \forall y, P(x,y)</m> means that for all <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <m>\forall x, \exists y, P(x,y)</m> means that for all <m>x</m>, there exists a <m>y</m> such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
            <li>
                <m>\exists x, \forall y, P(x,y)</m> means that there exists <m>x</m>, such that for all <m>y</m>, <m>P(x,y)</m> is true.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The first statement means that given a particular value of <m>x</m>, there exists a <m>y</m> (which can depend on <m>x</m>) such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true. In contrast, the second statement says that there exists a value of <m>x</m> (which is chosen first), such that <m>P(x,y)</m> is true for all values of <m>y</m>. The difference is the order in which the variables are chosen. The second kind of mixed quantifiers is often a stronger statement.
        </p>

        <me>
            \neg \brac{\forall x, \exists y, P(x,y)} = \exists x, \forall y, \neg P(x,y)
        </me>
        <me>
            \neg \brac{\exists x, \forall y, P(x,y)} = \forall x, \exists y, P(x,y)
        </me>
