        <p>
            To prove that an object <m>A</m> is unique, the typical method is to assume there exists two objects <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> which both satisfy the desired properties. Then, show that these two objects are equal, <m>A = B</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some sense, this is a proof by contradiction. That is,

        <ol>
            <li>By contradiction, assume that there exists <m>A, B</m> which satisfy the properties, and that <m>A \neq B</m>.</li>
            <li>Show that <m>A = B</m>, contradicting the initial assumption.</li>
