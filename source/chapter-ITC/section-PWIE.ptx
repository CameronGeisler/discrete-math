    <title>Permutations with Identical Elements</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Recall that the number of permutations of <m>n</m> unique objects <m>n</m> at a time is <m>n!</m>. However, if some of those <m>n</m> objects are identical, this number is reduced, because some permutations are indistinguishable.
        </p>
        
        <example>
            <p>
                For example, consider the number of permutation of letters in the word <m>WOOD</m>. If all the letters were distinct, the number of arrangements would be <m>4! = 24</m>. However, <m>WOOD</m> contains two <m>O</m>s (say, <m>O_1</m> and <m>O_2</m>) and so the permutation <m>WO_1 O_2 D</m> is indistinguishable to <m>WO_2 O_1 D</m> (they are both <m>WOOD</m>). When counting only unique permutations, these two (<m>2! = 2</m> are counted as one. Each permutation of <m>WO_1 O_2 D</m> (with subscripts) can be arranged in groups of <m>2 = 2!</m>, where every group corresponds to a single permutation of <m>WOOD</m> (without subscripts). Then, the number of permutations of <m>WOOD</m> is,

                Similarly, consider the word <m>BUBBLE</m>. There are three <m>B</m>s (say <m>B_1, B_2, B_3</m>) and so the 6 permutations,
                <me>
                    B_1 U B_2 B_3 LE \quad B_1 U B_3 B_2 LE \quad B_2 U B_1 B_3 LE \quad B_2 U B_3 B_1 LE \quad B_3 U B_1 B_2 LE \quad B_3 U B_2 B_1 LE
                </me>
                are all indistinguishable. In general, any rearrangement of these B's will not create a new permutation. There are <m>6 = 3!</m> ways to arrange these 3 B's, so the number of permutations is,

        <title>Permutations with Identical Objects</title>

        <theorem>
            <title>Permutation with identical objects</title>
            <p>
                The number of permutations of <m>n</m> objects with <m>n</m> identical objects is,
            </p>
            <me>
                \boxed{\frac{n!}{r!}}
            </me>
        </theorem>

        <p>
            This can be extended to permutations with multiple groups of identical objects.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                Consider 5 soup cans, made up of 3 noodle soup cans and 2 tomato soup cans. The 3 noodle soup cans are identical, so they can be arranged in <m>3! = 6</m> indistinguishable ways. Similarly, the 2 tomato soup cans can be arranged in <m>2! = 2</m> indistinguishable ways. Then, the number of permutations is,
            </p>
            <me>
                \frac{5!}{3! 2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10
            </me>
        </example>

        <theorem>
            <title>Permutations with multiple groups of identical objects</title>
            <p>
                The number of permutations of <m>n</m> objects with <m>n_1</m> identical objects of one kind, <m>n_2</m> identical objects of another kind, and so on for <m>k</m> kinds of objects, is,
            </p>
            <me>
                \boxed{\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}}
            </me>
            <p>
                Here, <m>n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k = n</m>.
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <p>
            Note that if all of the objects are unique, then <m>n_i = 1</m> for every <m>i</m>, and the expression simplifies to <m>n!</m>, as from before.

        <title>Anagrams</title>
        <p>
            An <term>anagram</term> is a word or phrase formed by rearranging (i.e. permuting) the letters of a different word or phrase.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, anagrams are a type of permutation, and so given a certain word (simplify this by not counting multiple words with spaces), how many anagrams of that word exist? Again, simplify things by saying that any arrangement of letters is a <q>word</q> whether or not that word is a real word or even pronounceable.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                Determine the number of anagrams that can be formed from the word COMBINATORICS.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 13 letters, with O and I both repeated twice. Thus, the number of anagrams is,
            </p>
            <me>
                \frac{13!}{2!2!} = 1556755200
            </me>
