    <title>More About Sets</title>

    <subsection>
        <p>
            The term <em>set</em> was first introduced by Georg Cantor (1845-1918).
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of set equality can be written as,
        </p>
        <me>
            A = B \leftrightarrow \brac{x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B}
        </me>
        <p>
            In fact, the unrestricted use of this notation leads to real contradictions in set theory (naive set theory).
        </p>
        <p>
            These sets have the following inclusion relationship,
        </p>
        <me>
            \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}
        </me>

        <title>Well-Defined Sets</title>
        <p>
            Sets must be <term>well-defined</term>, in that it must be clear and unambiguous which elements are in the set and which are not. In other words, given any object, it must be clear whether that object is in the set or not.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                The set of all young adults is not well-defined, because it depends on the definition of <q>young adult</q>. The set of all people aged 20 or older is well-defined.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                The set of the top 5 airports in the country is not well-defined, because the quality of an airport is subjective and up to interpretation.
            </p>
        </example>

        <title>Cardinality</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be a set. The <term>cardinality</term> (or <term>size</term> or <term>cardinal number</term>) of a set <m>A</m>, denoted by <m>n(A)</m> or <m>\abs{A}</m>, is the number of elements in <m>A</m>.
                <ul>
                    <li>The empty set has cardinality zero, <m>\abs{\emptyset} = 0</m>, and it is the unique set with this property.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </definition>

        <title>Aside on Definitions</title>
        <p>
            Definitions are very important in mathematics to facilitate clear communication of ideas. However, it is an unfortunate fact that it is impossible to define every concept. Recall that a set is defined as a <q>collection of distinct objects</q>. This naturally leads to the question of how a collection is defined. After all, <q>set</q> and <q>collection</q> seem to be almost synonyms, so defining one in terms of the other seems unhelpful. Theoretically, we could define <q>collection</q>, say as an group or aggregate of things. This isn't much more helpful, since now we would have to define a group or aggregate. This could continue indefinitely, until we run out of suitable words.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way, a concept like a set is simply defined intuitively. For most purposes, this will be sufficient.

        <title>Sets Inside Sets</title>
        <p>
            A set is a collection of objects, and sets are themselves objects. Then, a set can include other sets among its elements.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                Note that <m>1 \in \set{1,3}</m> (the object 1 is in the set containing 1 and 3), but <m>\set{1} \not\in \set{1,3}</m> (the set containing 1 is not an element of the set containing 1 and 3). However, <m>\set{1} \in \set{\set{1},3}</m> (the set containing 1 is an element of the set containing 3 and the set containing 1). In general, an object is not the same as a set containing that object.
            </p>
        </example>

            \caption*{For example, $A = \set{\text{cat}, \set{\text{cat}}}$. This set $A$ contains a cat, and a set that contains a cat. Representing sets as a box, we have a box that contains a cat and a box with a cat inside it.}

        <title>Finite and Infinite Sets</title>
        <p>
            Some sets have infinitely many elements. In roster notation, which can be indicated by an ellipsis <q><m>\dots</m></q>.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                Intuitively, a <term>finite</term> set has a finite number of elements, i.e. the number of elements in the set is a whole number. An <term>infinite</term> set has infinitely many elements, i.e. the number of elements in the set is not a whole number.
            </p>
        </definition>
    </subsection>
    
    <!-- \section*{Infinite Sets}
    Some sets have infinitely many elements, which can be indicated by an ellipsis ``$\dots$". For example, the natural numbers,
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathbb{N} = \set{1, 2, 3, \dots}
    \end{equation*}
   
    \section*{Venn Diagrams, Euler Diagrams}
    Relationships between sets can be represented graphically using a Venn diagram, or a Euler diagram.
    
    \section*{Applications of Venn Diagrams}
    \begin{theorem}[Addition Rule for Counting]
    \begin{equation*}
        n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
    \end{equation*}
    \end{theorem}
    
    \section*{Aside on Sets and Math Definitions}
    Most mathematical objects are ``formally" defined in terms of sets. For example, functions are defined as a particular kind of set. In fact, numbers, such as the natural numbers, can be defined using sets. -->
