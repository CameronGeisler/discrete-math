    <title>Proof by Mathematical Induction</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Mathematical induction is a method for proving statements about the set of natural numbers. Since there are infinitely many natural numbers, a general statement about the natural numbers cannot be proven by showing it for certain cases. Math induction allows us to prove a statement for all natural numbers, in a relatively concise way.

        <title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
        <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be a statement depending on <m>n</m>, where <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>. Then, for each <m>n</m>, <m>P(n)</m> is either true or false. Then,
        </p>
        <theorem>
            <title>Principle of mathematical induction</title>
            <p>
                A statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for all natural numbers <m>n</m> if,
                <ul>
                    <li><m>P(1)</m> is true (called the <term>base case</term>).</li>
                    <li>For all <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>, if <m>P(k)</m> is true, then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true (called the <term>induction step</term>). The assumption that <m>P(k)</m> is true is called the <term>inductive hypothesis</term>.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </theorem>

    <subsection>
        <title>Intuition for Math Induction</title>
        <p>
            Math induction makes intuitive sense. Suppose that <m>P(1)</m> is true, and for all <m>k</m>, if <m>P(k)</m> is true implies <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Then, applying this for <m>k = 1</m> means that <m>P(2)</m> is true. Then, since <m>P(2)</m> is true, this implies that <m>P(3)</m> is true. Since <m>P(3)</m> is true, <m>P(4)</m> is true, and so on. Then, for any <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, we can apply the implication enough times to show that <m>P(n)</m> is true.
        </p>
        <p>
            Math induction is like an infinite sequence of dominoes. To ensure that <q>all</q> of the dominoes will be knocked, we must be certain that,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first domino will be knocked over (the base case).</li>
            <li>The dominoes are set up such that if one domino falls, then the next domino will fall (the induction step).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In a similar way, the principle of math induction can be thought of as climbing a ladder. If you can climb onto the first rung, and also always climb one rung higher, then you can climb the <q>entire</q> ladder.

        <title>Basic Examples</title>

        <fact>
            <title>Product of consecutive integers is even</title>
            <p>
                For all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, <m>n(n + 1)</m> is even.
            </p>
        </fact>
        <p>
            This is true for all <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> however we will only prove it for positive integers. This can be proved without induction, since at least one of <m>n</m> and <m>(n + 1)</m> is even (if <m>n</m> is even, then <m>(n + 1)</m> is odd, and if <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>(n + 1)</m> is even). Thus, <m>n(n + 1)</m> is the product of an even and odd integer, which is even.
        </p>
        <proof>
            <p>
                By induction, for <m>n = 1</m>, we have <m>1 \cdot (1 + 1) = 2</m> which is even. Then, assume the result is true for some <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \geq 1</m>, that <m>n(n + 1)</m> is even. Then, we want to show that <m>(n + 1)((n + 1) + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)</m> is even. Then,
                <md>
                    <mrow>(n + 1)(n + 2) \amp = n^2 + 3n + 2</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = (n^2 + n) + (2n + 2) \amp\amp \text{splitting up the terms to use the induction hypothesis}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = n(n + 1) + 2(n + 1)</mrow>
                </md>
                By the induction hypothesis, <m>n(n + 1)</m> is even, and also <m>2(n + 1)</m> is even, so their sum <m>(n + 1)(n + 2)</m> is even.
            </p>
        </proof>

        <fact>
            <title>Binomial approximation</title>
            <p>
                For all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}, x \in \mathbb{R}</m>, if <m>x > -1</m>, then <m>(1 + x)^n \geq 1 + nx</m>.
            </p>
        </fact>
        <proof>
            <p>
                By induction, for <m>n = 1</m>, we have,
                <me>
                    (1 + x)^1 = 1 + x \geq 1 + 1 \cdot x
                </me>
                Then, assume that our result is true for <m>n = k \in \mathbb{N}</m>, and we want to show that,
                <me>
                    (1 + x)^{k+1} \geq 1 + (k + 1)x
                </me>
                Then,
                <md>
                    <mrow>(1 + x)^{k+1} \amp = (1 + x)^k(1 + x)</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp \geq (1 + kx)(1 + x) \amp\amp \text{as $(1 + x)^k \geq 1 + kx$ and $1 + x > 0$}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = 1 + x + kx + x^2</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = 1 + (k + 1)x + kx^2</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp \geq 1 + (k + 1)x \amp\amp \text{as $kx^2 \geq 0$}</mrow>
                </md>
                By induction, the result is true for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.

        <title>Using Proof by Induction</title>
        <ol>
            <li>State that you are using a proof by induction, by saying <q>By induction, ...</q> or similar. If there are multiple variables that are natural numbers, then specify explicitly which is being used as the index by saying for example, <q>By induction on <m>n</m>, ...</q>.</li>
            <li>Prove the base case is true.</li>
            <li>Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>, and use that assumption with some mathematical reasoning to prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.</li>
            <li>Finally, recall again the conclusion of the proof.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The most difficult and important part of induction is the inductive step. Often, the inductive step involves showing that the <m>(k+1)</m>th case can be written <em>in terms of</em> the <m>k</m>th case, in some way. This will allow you to use the inductive assumption.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>General Principle of Math Induction</title>
        <p>
            Sometimes, we only want to prove a statement for all natural numbers, starting at some integer that is not 1. Perhaps that for smaller natural numbers, the statement is false or is undefined. The principle of math induction still holds.
        </p>
        <p>
            For <m>b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, a statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>n \geq b</m> if,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><m>P(b)</m> is true, and,</li>
            <li>For all <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>k \geq b</m>, if <m>P(k)</m> is true, then <m>P(k + 1)</m> is true.</li>
        </ul>

        <fact>
            <title>Factorials are even</title>
            <p>
                For all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 2</m>, <m>n!</m> is even.
            </p>
        </fact>
        <p>
            Of course, this is trivial since <m>n!</m> contains a factor of 2 for all <m>n \geq 2</m>, and so is even. However, we can also prove this by induction.
        </p>
        <proof>
            <p>
                By induction, for <m>n = 2</m>, <m>2! = 2</m> is even. Then, assume the result is true for some <m>n \geq 2</m>, that <m>n!</m> is even. Then,
                <me>
                    (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n!
                </me>
                Since <m>n!</m> is even, <m>(n + 1) \cdot n!</m> is even, as any multiple of an even integer is even.
            </p>
        </proof>
