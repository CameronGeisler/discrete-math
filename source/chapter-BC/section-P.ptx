    <title>Permutations</title>

        <p>
            Consider a collection of objects. To <term>permute</term> these objects means to rearrange their order. A <term>permutation</term> is one of these such rearrangements, or orderings. Intuitively, it is a way to <q>sequence</q> or <q>line up</q> the objects. The fundamental counting principle allows us to determine the number of ways to arrange objects, or the number of permutations of objects.

        <example>
            <p>
                How many different ways are there to arrange 5 people in a line? By the fundamental counting principle, there are 5 selections in total. For the first spot, we can choose any of the 5 people. For the second spot, we can choose anyone except the 1st person, so there are 4 options. For the 3rd spot, there are 3 options as we can't choose the 1st nor 2nd person. For the 4th spot, there are only 2 options. Finally, for the last spot, there is only 1 person left, so there is only 1 option. Thus, in total, the number of ways to arrange 5 people is given by,

                    5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 5! = 120

        <p>
            More generally, consider the permutations of <m>n</m> objects. This can be viewed as a series of choices, filling in <m>n</m> positions using the <m>n</m> objects. For the first spot, we can choose any of the <m>n</m> objects, and so there are <m>n</m> choices. For the second spot, one of the objects has been taken, so there are <m>n-1</m> choices for the object in the 2nd position. Similarly, there <m>n-2</m> for the 3rd position, and so on. For the second-last object, there will be 2 positions left and so there are 2 choices, and the last object will only have one available slot left, and so there will be only 1 choice. In summary,

        <theorem>
            <title>Permutations of <m>n</m> objects</title>
            <p>
                The number of permutations of <m>n</m> objects is <m>n!</m>.
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <example>
            <p>
                Consider <m>n</m> boys and <m>n</m> girls. Consider the number of ways that they can form couples (assume only couples of mixed gender). The first boy can <q>choose</q> from all <m>n</m> of the girls (you could view this as the girls choosing boys, it would be equivalent). Then, the second boy has <m>n-1</m> choices, the third has <m>n-2</m> choices, and so on. Thus, there are <m>n(n - 1)(n - 2) \cdots 2 \cdot 1 = n!</m> ways to form these couples.

        <title>Permutations of <m>r</m> Elements from <m>n</m> Elements</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>permutation of <m>r</m> elements from a set of <m>n</m></term> unique elements is any of the specific orderings or arrangement, without repetition, of <m>r</m> elements.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Each rearrangement of these <m>r</m> elements is a different permutation. Of course, here <m>r</m> is an integer and <m>1 \leq r \leq n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider these <m>n</m> elements taken <m>r</m> at a time. Using the FCP, there are <m>n</m> ways to choose the first of the <m>r</m> elements, <m>n-1</m> ways to choose the second element, and so on. For each element, there are <m>n - (\text{object number} - 1)</m> ways to choose it. Thus, there are <m>n - (r - 1) = n - r + 1</m> ways to choose the <m>r</m>th (the final) element. Thus,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\nPr{n}{r} \amp = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \cdots (n - r + 1)</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            This can be rewritten more simply in terms of factorials, to produce a formula without <m>\dots</m>.
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\nPr{n}{r} \amp = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \cdots (n - r + 1) \cdot \frac{(n - r)!}{(n - r)!} \amp\amp \text{multiplying and dividing by $(n - r)!$}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2) \cdots (n - r + 1)(n - r)!}{(n - r)!}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            In summary,
        </p>
        <theorem>
            <p>
                The number of permutations of <m>n</m> unique objects taken <m>r</m> at a time is denoted by <m>\nPr{n}{r}</m>, and is given by,
                <me>
                    \boxed{\nPr{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}}
                </me>
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <p>
            This formula is a generalization of the FCP. If there are <m>n</m> elements taken <m>n</m> at a time, then using the permutation formula,
        </p>
        <me>
            \nPr{n}{n} = \frac{n!}{(n - n)!} = \frac{n!}{0!} = \frac{n!}{1} = n!
        </me>
        <p>
            which is consistent with the FCP. Also, notice that these two methods mean that the following equality must hold,
        </p>
        <me>
            \underbrace{\frac{n!}{0!}}_{\text{from permutation formula}} = \underbrace{n!}_{\text{from FCP}}
        </me>
        <p>
            Thus, <m>0!</m> must be equal to 1. This is one reason why zero factorial is defined to be one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recall that a permutation of <m>r</m> elements from an <m>n</m> element set consists of choosing <m>r</m> elements from the set in a particular order. We can view this as choosing an <q>ordered subset</q> of <m>r</m> elements from an <m>n</m> element set.
        </p>

        <example>
            <p>
                Consider <m>\nPr{n}{1}</m>, the number of permutations of <m>n</m> objects taking 1 at a time. Intuitively, we know that there are <m>n</m> permutations (one for choosing each of the <m>n</m> objects). Using the permutation formula,
                <me>
                    \nPr{n}{1} = \frac{n!}{(n - 1)!} = \frac{n(n - 1)!}{(n - 1)!} = n
                </me>
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                How many different signals can be made by using at least 4 different flags from a selection of 6 different flags?
            </p>
            <p>
                Signals are different depending on the order of the flags presented. At least 4 different flags means a signal could use 4, 5, or 6 flags. Thus, the number of different signals is given by,
                <me>
                    \nPr{6}{4} + \nPr{6}{5} + \nPr{6}{6} = 720 + 720 + 360 = 1800
                </me>
            </p>

        <example>
            <p>
                A race has 7 competitors. Determine the number of ways the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place medals be awarded.
            </p>
            <p>
                When choosing these 3 medals, order matters. So, there are <m>\nPr{7}{3} = 210</m> ways.

    <!-- \section*{Solving Equations with Permutations}
    \begin{example}
    Solve $\nPr{n}{3} = 60$
    \\ \\ Using the permutation formula,
    \begin{align*}
        60 \amp = \frac{n!}{(n - 3)!} \\
        60 \amp = \frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)!}{(n - 3)!} \\
        60 \amp = n(n - 1)(n - 2)
    \end{align*}
    Using logical reasoning, we want to find 3 consecutive integers whose product is 60. Note that $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$, and by inspection, $3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 60$, and so $n = 5$.
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{example}
    Solve ${}_nP_2 = 56$
    \\ \\ Using the permutation formula,
    \begin{align*}
        56 \amp = \frac{n!}{(n - 2)!} \\
        56 \amp = \frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)!}{(n - 2)!} \\
        56 \amp = n(n - 1)
    \end{align*}
    Using logical reasoning, we want to find 2 consecutive integers whose product is 56. By inspection, $7 \cdot 8 = 56$, and so $n = 8$. Alternatively, we can solve the quadratic equation for $n$,
    \begin{align*}
        56 \amp = n(n - 1) \\
        0 \amp = n^2 - n - 56 \\
        0 \amp = (n - 8)(n + 7) \\
        n \amp = 8, -7
    \end{align*}
    Since $n \geq 0$, $n = 8$.
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{example}
    Solve ${}_5P_r = 20$
    \\ \\ Using the permutation formula,
    \begin{align*}
        20 \amp = \frac{5!}{(5 - r)!} \\
        20 \amp = \frac{120}{(5 - r)!} \\
        (5 - r)! \amp = 6 \\
        (5 - r)! \amp = 3! \amp\amp \text{as $6 = 3!$} \\
        5 - r \amp = 3 \\
        r \amp = 2
    \end{align*}
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{example}
    Solve ${}_6P_r = 30$
    \\ \\ Using the permutation formula,
    \begin{align*}
        30 \amp = \frac{6!}{(6 - r)!} \\
        30 \amp = \frac{720}{(6 - r)!} \\
        (6 - r)! \amp = 24 \\
        (6 - r)! \amp = 4! \amp\amp \text{as $24 = 4!$} \\
        6 - r \amp = 4 \\
        r \amp = 2
    \end{align*}
    \end{example} -->
