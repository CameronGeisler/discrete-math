    <title>Equivalence Relations</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In mathematics, sometimes objects which are technically different are considered equal. This notion of a generalized form of equality is made precise with the concept of an <em>equivalence relation</em>.

            Let <m>R</m> be a relation on a set <m>A</m>.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <ul>
                <li><m>R</m> is <term>reflexive</term> if for all <m>a \in A</m>, <m>a R a</m>.</li>
                <li><m>R</m> is <term>symmetric</term> if for all <m>a, b \in A</m>, if <m>a R b</m>, then <m>b R a</m>.</li>
                <li><m>R</m> is <term>transitive</term> if for all <m>a, b, c \in A</m>, if <m>a R b</m> and <m>b R c</m>, then <m>a R c</m>.</li>

                A relation <m>R</m> is an <term>equivalence relation</term> if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

            Intuitively, equivalence relations are a generalization of <q>equality</q> in that related elements <m>a, b</m> share some property common.
        </p>

        <example>
            <p>
                The canonical example of an equivalence relation is equality <m>=</m> on <m>\mathbb{R}</m> (or on any subset of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, or on <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, etc.).

        <title>Congruence Modulo <m>n</m> as an Equivalence Relation</title>
        <p>
            The relation of congruence modulo <m>n</m> is an equivalence relation.
        </p>
        <theorem>
            <p>
                Let <m>\equiv \pmod{n}</m> be the relation such that for <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>a \equiv b</m> if <m>a - b = kn</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then, <m>\equiv \pmod{n}</m> is an equivalence relation.
            </p>
        </theorem>
        <proof>
            <ul>
                <li>Let <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then, <m>a - a = 0</m>, and <m>n \mid 0</m>, so <m>n \mid (a - a)</m>.</li>
                <li>Let <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, with <m>a \equiv b \pmod{n}</m>. Then, <m>n \mid (a - b)</m>, so <m>a - b = kn</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then, <m>b - a = (-k)n</m>, and since <m>-k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>n \mid (b - a)</m>. Thus, <m>b \equiv a \pmod{n}</m>.</li>
                <li>
                    Let <m>a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, with <m>a \equiv b \pmod{n}</m> and <m>b \equiv c \pmod{n}</m>. Then, <m>n \mid (a - b)</m> and <m>n \mid (b - c)</m>. Then, <m>a - b = kn</m> and <m>b - c = ln</m> for some <m>k, l \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then,
                    <me>
                        a - c = (b + kn) - (b - ln) = kn + ln = (k + l)n
                    </me>
                    Then, <m>k + l \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, so <m>n \mid (a - c)</m>, and so <m>a \equiv c \pmod{n}</m>.
                </li>

                Let <m>S</m> be the set of all triangles in the plane. Then, define a relation on <m>S</m> such that <m>a \sim b</m> if triangles <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are congruent (have the same side lengths and same angles). Then, this is an equivalence relation.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    First, note that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have equal parity if and only if <m>2 \mid (a - b)</m>.

                    <li>
                        Let <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then, <m>a - a = 0</m>, and <m>2 \mid 0</m>, so <m>2 \mid (a - a)</m>. Thus, <m>a R a</m>.

                        Let <m>a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>a R b</m>. Then, <m>2 \mid (a - b)</m>, so there exists <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>a - b = 2k</m>. Then, <m>b - a = 2(-k)</m> with <m>-k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, so <m>2 \mid (b - a)</m>. Thus, <m>b R a</m>.

                        <me>
                            a - c = (2m + b) - (b - 2n) = 2m - 2n = 2(m - n)

        <title>Equivalence Classes</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be an equivalence relation on a set <m>A</m>, <m>x \in A</m>. The <term>equivalence class</term> of <m>x</m>, denoted by <m>[x]_R</m> (or simply <m>[x]</m>), is the set of all elements in <m>A</m> that are related to <m>x</m>. In other words,
            </p>
            <me>
                [x]_{R} = \set{y \in A: y R x}
            </me>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Note that for any <m>x \in A</m>, <m>x \in [x]_R</m>, because <m>R</m> is reflexive. Thus, an equivalence class is made up of exactly all the elements that are related to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            We say that all the elements in an equivalence class are <term>equivalent</term> in the sense of the equivalence relation. Any element of an equivalence class is called a <term>representative</term> of that class. 
        </p>

        <theorem>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be an equivalence relation on a set <m>A</m>. Then, for all <m>x, y \in A</m>, <m>x R y</m> if and only if <m>[x] = [y]</m>.
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>[x] = [y]</m>. Since <m>x \in [x]</m> and <m>[x] = [y]</m>, we have <m>x \in [y]</m>. By definition of equivalence class, <m>x R y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, let <m>x, y \in A</m> with <m>x R y</m>. Then,
            </p>
            <md>
                <mrow>[x] \amp = \set{z \in A: z R x}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \set{z \in A: z R y} \amp\amp \text{$z R x$ and $x R y$, so $z R y$}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = [y]</mrow>
            </md>
        </proof>

        <corollary>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>. Then, for all <m>x, y \in A</m>, <m>[x]</m> and <m>[y]</m> are disjoint if and only if <m>[x] \neq [y]</m>.
            </p>
        </corollary>
        <proof>
            <p>
                If <m>[x] \cap [y] = \emptyset</m>, then we are done. Otherwise, if <m>[x] \cap [y] \neq \emptyset</m>, then there exists <m>z \in B</m>. Thus, <m>z \in [x]</m> and <m>z \in [y]</m>, so <m>z R x</m>, <m>z R y</m>, and since <m>R</m> is reflexive, <m>x R z</m>. Then, since <m>R</m> is transitive, <m>x R y</m>. Therefore, <m>[x] = [y]</m>.

        <title>Indefinite Integrals as Equivalence Classes (Calculus)</title>
        <p>
            You may recall that in integral calculus, the indefinite integral (or antiderivative) of a function <m>f</m> is denoted by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \int f(x) \,dx
        </me>
        <p>
            If <m>F</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m>, then it is often written as,
        </p>
        <me>
            \int f(x) \,dx = F(x) + C
        </me>
        <p>
            For example,
        </p>
        <me>
            \int 2x \,dx = x^2 + C
        </me>
        <p>
            The idea is that the indefinite integral of <m>f</m> is any function of the form <m>F(x) + C</m>, where <m>C \in \mathbb{R}</m> is any real number. In other words, <m>\int f(x) \,dx</m> is a family (or set) of functions, given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \int f(x) \,dx = \set{F(x): F'(x) = f(x)}
        </me>
        <p>
            Then, we know that if <m>F</m> is any particular function from this set, then this is equivalently,
        </p>
        <me>
            \int f(x) \,dx = \set{F(x) + C: C \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            In fact, this set can be thought of formally as an equivalence class. Define the relation <m>\sim</m> on the set of functions, such that <m>f \sim g</m> if and only if <m>f' = g'</m>, equivalently, if and only if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> differ by a constant, i.e. <m>f = g + C</m> for some <m>C \in \mathbb{R}</m>. Then, this is an equivalence relation.
        </p>
        <proof>
            <p>
                First, <m>f = f + 0</m>, so <m>f \sim f</m>. Also, if <m>f = g + C</m>, then <m>g = f + (-C)</m>. Finally, if <m>f = g + C</m> and <m>g = h + D</m>, then <m>f = h + (C + D)</m>.
            </p>
        </proof>

        <p>
            Then, the equivalence class of <m>f</m>, <m>[f]</m>, is given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            [f] = \set{g: g = f + C, C \in \mathbb{R}} = \set{f + C: C \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            Thus, the indefinite integral of <m>f</m> is the equivalence class of functions that only differ by a constant,
        </p>
        <me>
            \int f(x) \,dx = [F(x)]
        </me>
        <p>
            This equivalence relation provides a generalized notion of equality. From the perspective of indefinite integrals, <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^2 + 1</m> are equal up to a constant. And, for the purposes of indefinite integration, we disregard constant differences between functions.
