        <title>Binary</title>
        <p>
            Binary is a base-2 number system, in that each digit represents a power of 2. Then, each digit is a bit, being either 0 or 1.

        <title>Converting from Decimal to Binary</title>
        <p>
            For a number <m>n</m> is decimal, determine the highest power of 2 which is less than or equal to <m>n</m>.

        <title>Operations in Binary</title>
        <p>
            Addition in binary can be done just as elementary school addition with decimal numbers, with carries for digit sums which are 2 or greater.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, subtraction, with borrowing if necessary.

        <title>Hexadecimal</title>
        <p>
            Hexadecimal is base-16. It is more compact. The digits 10-15 are represented by A-F.
        </p>
        <p>
            To convert binary to hexadecimal, separate the number into 4-digit blocks, adding leading 0's as necessary. Consider each block as a number from 0-15, and convert it into the hexadecimal equivalent. Then, append the hexadecimal digits to form the hexadecimal number.
        </p>
        <p>
            To convert from hexadecimal to binary, convert each hexadecimal digit to a string of 4 binary digits, and append these 4-digit blocks to form the binary number.
