    <title>Important Sets of Numbers</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In mathematics, naturally, the most important sets are sets containing numbers.

        <title>Important Number Sets</title>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <term>Natural numbers</term>. These are the numbers used for counting,
                <me>
                    \mathbb{N} = \set{1, 2, 3, \dots}
                </me>
                Note that some mathematicians, and especially computer scientists, include 0 as a natural number.
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Whole numbers</term>. If one considers the natural numbers to not include zero, then the whole numbers are the natural numbers, including zero.
                <me>
                    \set{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots}
                </me>
                Sometimes, the whole numbers are represented by <m>\mathbb{W}</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Integers</term>. The set including all whole numbers and the negatives of the natural numbers,
                <me>
                    \mathbb{Z} = \set{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots}
                </me>
                The integers are denoted by Z because the German word for number is <em>Zahlen</em>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To avoid ambiguity, some people write <m>\mathbb{Z}^{+}</m> to represent the <term>postive integers</term>, rather than using the term natural numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, sometimes, the set of whole numbers is referred to as the <term>non-negative integers</term>.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <term>Rational numbers</term> (or <term>fractions</term>, or simply <term>rationals</term>). The set of all numbers that can be represented as a quotient of two integers (of course, such that the denominator isn't 0). Represented as decimals, rational numbers are terminating or repeating decimals.
                <me>
                    \mathbb{Q} = \set{\frac{a}{b}: a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0}
                </me>
                The rationals are denoted by Q for <q>quotient</q>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Irrational numbers</term>. The set of all numbers which cannot be represented as quotients of integers, and whose decimal representations are neither terminating nor repeating. Sometimes, it is denoted by <m>\mathbb{I}</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Real numbers</term> <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. The set including all rational and irrational numbers. Broadly, it is the set of all decimal numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Complex numbers</term> <m>\mathbb{C}</m>. The set of all numbers of the form <m>a + bi</m>, where <m>a, b \in \mathbb{R}</m>, and <m>i</m> is the imaginary unit which satisfies <m>i^2 = -1</m>. In other words,
                <me>
                    \mathbb{C} = \set{a + bi: a, b \in \mathbb{R}}
                </me>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These sets have the following inclusion relationship,
        </p>
        <me>
            \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}
        </me>

        <title>Intervals of Real Numbers</title>
        <p>
            Intervals are a particular kind of subset of real numbers. Let <m>a \leq b</m>. Then,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <term>closed interval</term> <m>[a,b]</m> is the set,
                <me>
                    [a, b] = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \leq b}
                </me>
            </li>
            <li>
                An <term>open interval</term> <m>(a,b)</m> is the set,
                <me>
                    (a, b) = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \lt x \lt b}
                </me>
            </li>
            <li>
                A <term>half-open interval</term> is the set,
                <me>
                    (a, b] = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \lt x \leq b}
                </me>
                or,
                <me>
                    [a, b) = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \lt b}
                </me>
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Infinite intervals</term>. Can be of the form,
                <md>
                    <mrow>(a, \infty) \amp = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: x > a}</mrow>
                    <mrow>[a, \infty) = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: x \geq a}</mrow>
                    <mrow>(-\infty, b) = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: x \lt b}</mrow>
                    <mrow>(-\infty, b] = \set{x \in \mathbb{R}: x \leq b}</mrow>
                    <mrow>(-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}</mrow>
