    <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            A sequence is an ordered list of objects. Sequences are patterns of numbers.
        </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
        <title>Sequences</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                Broadly, a <term>sequence</term> is an ordered list of objects.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Typically, a sequence is represented by a set of elements listed in a row,
        </p>
        <me>
            a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \dots, a_n
        </me>
        <p>
            Each element of a sequence is called a <term>term</term>. Then, the terms of the sequence are denoted by <m>a_k</m>, read as <q>a sub k</q>. The integer <m>k</m> is called a <term>subscript</term>, or <term>index</term>, because it indicates the position of each term in the list. The first term is <m>a_1</m>, the second term is <m>a_2</m>, the third term is <m>a_3</m>, and so on. The tenotation <m>a_n</m> represents the <m>n</m>th term, or the <term>general term</term>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A sequence can be thought of more formally as a function <m>f</m>, whose domain is all the integers between two given integers, or all the integers greater than or equal to a given integer. Then,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>f(1) \amp = a_1</mrow>
            <mrow>f(2) \amp = a_2</mrow>
            <mrow>f(3) \amp = a_3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>f(n) \amp = a_n</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            We can also consider sequences which continue indefinitely, called <term>infinite sequences</term> (in contrast, sequences with finitely many terms are called <term>finite sequences</term>). Infinite sequences are commonly studied in calculus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, a sequence can be started at an index other than 1, sometimes 0 or 2. More generally,
        </p>
        <me>
            a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2}, \dots, a_n
        </me>
        <p>
            where <m>n \geq m</m>.
        </p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Specifying a Sequence</title>
        <p>
            There are multiple ways to define a sequence.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><term>List the first few terms</term>, followed by an ellipsis <m>\dots</m> (where <m>\dots</m> means <q>and so on</q>).</li>
        </ul>
        <example>
            <p>
                The sequence,
                <me>
                    \set{a_n} = \set{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots}
                </me>
                is the sequence of natural numbers. It continues, 6, 7, 8, and so on.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            This only works if the pattern is obvious from the first few terms.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><term>Provide a formula for the general term</term>. Give an <term>explicit formula</term> for the general term <m>a_n</m> as a function of <m>n</m>. In other words, write <m>a_n = f(n)</m>, where <m>f(n)</m> is some expression involving <m>n</m>.</li>
        </ul>

        <example>
            <p>
                The sequence of natural numbers can be written as <m>a_n = n</m> for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                The sequence,
                <me>
                    \set{a_n} = \set{2, 4, 6, 8, \dots}
                </me>
                is the sequence of even natural numbers, given by <m>a_n = 2n</m> for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                For example, <m>a_n = \sqrt{n}</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                For example, the sequence <m>a_n = (-1)^{n+1}</m>, or,
                <me>
                    \set{a_n} = \set{1, -1, 1, -1, \dots}
                </me>
            </p>
        </example>

        <title>Sequences in Python</title>
        <p>
            Given the formula for the general term of a sequence, Python can be used to compute a partial list of values of the sequence.
        </p>
        <cd>
            seq = [a(i) for i in range(1,n+1)]
        </cd>
        <p>
            This syntax means to create a list <c>seq</c> by evaluating the function <c>a(i)</c> for the integers in the range from <m>i = 1</m> to <m>i = n</m>, and adding each result to the list. Then, define the function <c>a(i)</c> based on the formula for the particular sequence. This syntax is called a <em>list comprehension</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            More generally, the sequence can start at an integer <m>m</m> other than 1,
        </p>
        <cd>
            seq = [a(i) for i in range(m,n+1)]
        </cd>
        <p>
            The above syntax is equivalent to the more lengthy syntax,
        </p>
        <cd>
            seq = []
            for i in range(1,n+1):
                seq.append(a(i))
        </cd>

    <subsection>
        <title>Infinite Sequences</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                An <term>infinite sequence</term> (or simply <term>sequence</term>) is an ordered collection of numbers with infinitely many elements.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            An arbitrary infinite sequence can be represented by the notation,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <m>\set{a_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> i.e. the set of all <m>a_n</m> where <m>n = 1, 2, 3, \dots</m> <q>up to infinity</q>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <m>\set{a_n}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}</m>, i.e. <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> is any natural number.
            </li>
            <li>
                Or, simply by <m>\set{a_n}</m>, especially if the starting index is arbitrary.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An infinite sequence can be thought of as a function whose domain is all natural numbers, or the set of all positive integers greater than or equal to some integer.
        </p>
