    <title>Introduction to Sets</title>

    <subsection>
        <title>Sets</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                Roughly, a <term>set</term> is a collection of distinct objects, called <term>elements</term> (or <term>members</term>).
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets are typically represented by capital letters, like <m>A, B, S</m>, etc.</li>
                    <li>The objects in sets can be pretty much anything, i.e. they need not be numbers.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Sets can be defined by listing the elements within <term>set braces</term>, <m>\{ \text{ and } \}</m>, separated by commas. For example, the set containing the integers 1, 2, and 4 would be written as,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{1, 2, 4}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is called the \textbf{roster method}, because it involes simply listing the elements of the set.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an object <m>x</m> is an element of the set <m>A</m>, we write <m>x \in A</m>. Otherwise, we write <m>x \notin A</m> For each object <m>x</m> and set <m>A</m>, either <m>x \in A</m> or <m>x \notin A</m>, but not both.
        </p>

        <example>
            Note that <m>1 \in \set{1,3}</m> (the object 1 is in the set containing 1 and 3), but <m>\set{1} \not\in \set{1,3}</m> (the set containing 1 is not an element of the set containing 1 and 3). However, <m>\set{1} \in \set{\set{1},3}</m> (the set containing 1 is an element of the set containing 3 and the set containing 1). In general, an object is not the same as a set containing that object. Also, note that sets are indeed themselves objects, so they can be included among the elements of a set.
        </example>

        <definition>
            <p>
                Two sets are <term>equal</term>, <m>A = B</m>, if and only if they contain exactly the same elements (up to ordering). Otherwise, they are not equal, <m>A \neq B</m>. In other words, two sets are not equal if at least one element is in one of the sets and is not in the other set.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <p>
            For example, <m>\set{1,2,3} = \set{2,3,1} = \set{3,2,1}</m>, but <m>\set{1,2} \neq \set{1,3}</m>.
        </p>

            <title>Aside on definitions</title>
            <p>
                Definitions are very important in mathematics to facilitate clear communication of ideas. However, it is an unfortunate fact that it is impossible to define every concept. Recall that a set is defined as a <q>collection of distinct objects</q>. This naturally leads to the question of how a collection is defined. After all, <q>set</q> and <q>collection</q> seem to be almost synonyms, so defining one in terms of the other seems unhelpful. Theoretically, we could define <q>collection</q>, say as an group or aggregate of things. This isn't much more helpful, since now we would have to define a group or aggregate. This could continue indefinitely, until we run out of suitable words. In this way, a concept like a set is simply defined intuitively.

        <title>Well-Defined Sets</title>
        <p>
            Sets must be <term>well-defined</term>, in that it must be clear and unambiguous which elements are in the set and which are not. In other words, given any object, it must be clear whether that object is in the set or not.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                The set of all young adults is not well-defined, because it depends on the definition of <q>young adult</q>. The set of all people aged 20 or older is well-defined.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                The set of the top 5 airports in the country is not well-defined, because the quality of an airport is subjective and up to interpretation.
            </p>
        </example>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Duplicate Elements</title>
        <p>
            Note that a set is a collection of <em>distinct</em> objects, so sets with duplicate objects are considered equal to the set without the duplicates. For example,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{1, 2} = \set{1, 2, 1} = \set{1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
        </me>
        <p>
            All of these sets are equal, but of course by convention, sets are written without duplicate elements.
        </p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Set-Builder Notation</title>
        <p>
            A set can also be defined based on all its elements sharing a common property. This can be done using <term>set-builder notation</term>, which defines a set as,
        </p>
        <me>
            A = \set{x: x \text{ has property } P}
        </me>
        <p>
            which means, <q><m>A</m> is the set of all objects <m>x</m> such that <m>x</m> has property <m>P</m></q>, or more concisely, <q><m>A</m> is the set of all objects <m>x</m> with property <m>P</m></q>. Here, the colon <m>:</m> means <q>such that</q>. Sometimes, we use a vertical bar <m>|</m> instead. Alternatively, it can be written as,
        </p>
        <me>
            A = \set{x \in X: x \text{ has property } P}
        </me>
        <p>
            which means, <q><m>A</m> is the set of all objects in <m>X</m> that satisfy property <m>P</m></q>. Here, the variable <m>x</m> is a \textit{dummy variable}, in that replacing <m>x</m> with any other variable or symbol does not change the set. For example,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{x \in X: x \text{ has property } P} = \set{y \in X: y \text{ has property } P}
        </me>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>The Empty Set</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>empty set</term> (or <term>null set</term>), denoted by <m>\emptyset</m> or <m>\set{}</m>, is the unique set with no elements.
            </p>
        </definition>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Cardinality</title>
        <definition>
            <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be a set. The <term>cardinality</term> (or <term>size</term> or <term>cardinal number</term>) of a set <m>A</m>, denoted by <m>n(A)</m> or <m>\abs{A}</m>, is the number of elements in <m>A</m>.
                <ul>
                    <li>The empty set has cardinality zero, <m>\abs{\emptyset} = 0</m>, and it is the unique set with this property.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </definition>
    </subsection>

        \includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{../images/sets1.jpg}
        \caption*{A set is a collection of elements, and other sets can be among those elements. For example, $A = \set{\text{cat}, \set{\text{cat}}}$. This set $A$ contains a cat, and a set that contains a cat. Representing sets as a box, we have a box that contains a cat and a box with a cat inside it.}
    \end{figure}
    
    \section*{Infinite Sets}
    Some sets have infinitely many elements, which can be indicated by an ellipsis ``$\dots$". For example, the natural numbers,
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathbb{N} = \set{1, 2, 3, \dots}
    \end{equation*}
    
    \begin{definition}
    A \textbf{finite} set has a finite number of elements, i.e. the number of elements in the set is a whole number. An \textbf{infinite} set has infinitely many elements, i.e. the number of elements in the set is not a whole number.
    \end{definition}
    
    \section*{Venn Diagrams, Euler Diagrams}
    Relationships between sets can be represented graphically using a Venn diagram, or a Euler diagram.
    
    \section*{Applications of Venn Diagrams}
    \begin{theorem}[Addition Rule for Counting]
    \begin{equation*}
        n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
    \end{equation*}
    \end{theorem}
    
    \section*{Aside on Sets and Math Definitions}
    Most mathematical objects are ``formally" defined in terms of sets. For example, functions are defined as a particular kind of set. In fact, numbers, such as the natural numbers, can be defined using sets. -->
