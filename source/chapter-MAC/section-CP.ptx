    <title>Circular Permutations</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Consider a necklace with <m>n</m> distinct beads. How many ways can the beads be arranged? Here, we consider two necklaces to be the same if one can be transformed to the other by a rotation. There are <m>n!</m> ways to order <m>n</m> distinct objects. However, for each of these permutations, there are <m>n</m> possible equivalent rotations. Thus, the number of necklace arrangements is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!
        </me>
        <p>
            Suppose further that two necklaces are considered the same if they can be reflected to another (which they can, in real life). For each of these <m>(n-1)!</m> arrangements, there are 2 equivalent reflections. Thus,

        <theorem>
            <p>
                The number of distinct necklaces arrangements that can be formed with <m>n</m> distinct beads is,
                <me>
                    \frac{(n-1)!}{2}
                </me>

    <!-- \begin{example}
    Determine the number of ways 13 couples can be seated at a round table if no couple can sit opposite to one another at the table.
    \\ \\ Suppose that the number of ways to seat 12 couples (24 people), such that no couple sits across from one another, is $a_{12}$. Then, there are 24 ways to ``insert" the partner A of the 13th couple (there are 24 possible spots between each pair of people), and another 24 ways to insert partner B (there are 25 possible spots but cannot be seated across from partner A). Thus,
    \begin{equation*}
        a_{13} = 24^2 a_{12}
    \end{equation*}
    A similar argument can be made to show that $a_{12} = 22^2 a_{11}$, $a_{11} = 20^2 a_{10}$, and in general $a_n = (2n - 2)^2 a_{n - 1}$. Then, by recursion,
    \begin{align*}
        a_{13} \amp = 24^2 a_{12} \\
        \amp = 24^2 \cdot 22^2 a_{11} \\
        \amp = 24^2 \cdot 22^2 \cdot 20^2 a_{10} \\
        \amp = \dots \\
        \amp = 24^2 \cdot 22^2 \cdot 20^2 \cdots 4^2 \cdot 2^2 a_1 \\
        \amp = 24^2 \cdot 22^2 \cdot 20^2 \cdots 4^2 \cdot 2^2
    \end{align*}
    and $a_1 = 1$, the number of ways to arrange 1 couple. The final answer can be simplified as $2^{24} (12!)^2$.
