        <title>Distributing Presents</title>
        <p>
            Suppose we have <m>n</m> presents to distribute to <m>k</m> children, such that each of the <m>n</m> children get <m>n_1, \dots, n_k</m> presents, respectively. Also, we want to all presents are distributed (i.e. <m>n_1 + \dots + n_k = n</m>). Then, we want to determine the number of ways this distribution can be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can determine this by arranging the <m>n</m> presents in a row, and having the child 1 take the first <m>n_1</m> presents starting from the left, then child 2 takes the next <m>n_2</m> presents, and so on, until child <m>k</m> takes the remaining $n_k$ presents.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are <m>n!</m> ways to arrange the presents, however, multiple arrangements can lead to the same result (i.e. every kid getting the same presents). If child 1 gets 5 presents, then the order in which those 5 presents are given to them doesn't matter. In general, the <m>i</m>th child can arrange their presents in <m>n_i!</m> ways. Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the presents is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
        </me>

        <title>Alternate Intuition</title>
        <p>
            Alternatively, we can think of this problem as choosing <m>n_1</m> presents to give to the first child (which there are <m>\binom{n}{n_1}</m> ways), then choosing <m>n_2</m> presents among the remaining <m>(n - n_1)</m> to give to the second child (<m>\binom{n-n_1}{n_2}</m> ways), and so on. In general, we choose <m>n_i</m> presents among the remaining <m>(n - n_1 - n_2 - \dots - n_{i-1})</m>, for <m>\binom{n-n_1-\dots-n_{i-1}}{n_i}</m> ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the presents is,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\amp \binom{n}{n_1} \binom{n-n_1}{n_2} \cdots \binom{n-n_1-\cdots-n_{k-1}}{n_k}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{n!}{n_1! (n - n_1)!} \cdot \frac{(n - n_1)!}{n_2! (n - n_1 - n_2)!} \cdots \frac{(n - n_1 - \dots - n_{k-1})!}{n_k! (n - n_1 - \dots - n_{k-1} - n_k)!}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}</mrow>
        </md>

        <title>Examples</title>
        <example>
            <p>
                If <m>n = k</m> and <m>n_1 = n_2 = \cdots = n_k = 1</m>, this represents distributing <m>k</m> presents (same number of presents as children) and giving each child exactly one present.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is just arranging the presents to determine which child gets which present, or <m>n!</m>. From this formula, we see it is also,
            </p>
            <me>
                \frac{n!}{1! 1! \cdots 1!} = n!
            </me>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                If <m>n_1 = n_2 = \cdots = n_{k-1} = 1</m> and <m>n_k = n - k + 1</m>, this represents giving all child 1 present, except the last child who gets the remaining <m>(n - k + 1)</m> presents.
            </p>
            <p>
                This involves choosing <m>(k - 1)</m> presents from the <m>n</m> available to give to the <m>(k-1)</m> children (<m>\binom{n}{k-1}</m> ways), and then giving the remaining presents to the last child. From the formula, we get,
            </p>
            <me>
                \frac{n!}{1!1! \cdots (n - k + 1)!} = \frac{n!}{(n - (k - 1))!} = \binom{n}{k-1}
