<p>Here, we will prove that the real number \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational, possibly one of the most well known proofs by contradiction. In ancient Greece (in 5th century BC), the Pythagoreans believed that all numbers were rational. To them, the term “number” meant rational number. However, Hippasus, a member of the Pythagoreans, was the first to publicly reveal that the square root of 2, was irrational. Here, the square root of 2 represented the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with side lengths 1. The Pythagoreans did not accept \(\sqrt{2}\) as a number, and supposedly, he was thrown off a boat and drowned. However, whether this actually happened is controversial.</p>
