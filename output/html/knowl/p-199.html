<p>For example, consider the number of permutation of letters in the word \(WOOD\text{.}\) If all the letters were distinct, the number of arrangements would be \(4! = 24\text{.}\) However, \(WOOD\) contains two \(O\)s (say, \(O_1\) and \(O_2\)) and so the permutation \(WO_1 O_2 D\) is indistinguishable to \(WO_2 O_1 D\) (they are both \(WOOD\)). When counting only unique permutations, these two (\(2! = 2\) are counted as one. Each permutation of \(WO_1 O_2 D\) (with subscripts) can be arranged in groups of \(2 = 2!\text{,}\) where every group corresponds to a single permutation of \(WOOD\) (without subscripts). Then, the number of permutations of \(WOOD\) is,</p>
