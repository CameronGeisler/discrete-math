<p>By induction, for \(n = 0\text{,}\) \(A = \emptyset\) has \(1 = 2^0\) subsets.</p>
<p>Then, assume the result is true for \(n = k \in \mathbb{N}\text{,}\) that every set with \(n\) elements has \(2^n\) subsets. Then, let \(B = \set{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, a_{n+1}\) be a set with \(n+1\) elements, and we want to show that \(B\) has \(2^{n+1}\) subsets.</p>
<p>Then, let \(B = A \cup \set{a_{n+1}}\) where \(A = \set{a_1, \dots, a_n}\) has \(n\) elements. Each subset \(X\) of \(A\) corresponds to 2 subsets of \(B\text{.}\) One is simply \(X\) itself, since every subset of \(A\) is also a subset of \(B\text{.}\) The other is the set \(X \cup \set{a_{n+1}}\text{.}\) Since there are \(2^n\) subsets of \(A\) and each corresponds to 2 subsets of \(B\text{,}\) this means there are at least \(2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1}\) subsets of \(B\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Also, any subset of \(B\) must either include \(a_{n+1}\) or not include \(a_{n+1}\text{.}\) If it includes \(a_{n+1}\text{,}\) then it must be of the form \(X \cup \set{a_{n+1}}\) for some subset \(X\) of \(A\text{.}\) If it doesn't include \(a_{n+1}\text{,}\) then it is a subset of \(A\text{.}\) In this way, we have accounted for every possible subset of \(B\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-MAS.html#proof-61">in-context</a></span>
