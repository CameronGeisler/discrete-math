<p>Consider a group of 5 distinct balls. How many ways can one choose a collection of 3 balls from these 5 balls? This can be framed as a permutation. List the balls from 1-5, and write I if the ball is included in the collection and E if it is excluded. For example, the particular collection of balls 2, 4, and 5 would be represented by \(EIEII\text{.}\) For another example, choosing balls 1, 2, and 3 is represented by \(IIIEE\text{.}\) In general, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the combinations of 5 balls taken 3 at a time, and permutations of this 5-character sequences of E's and I's. From permutations, we know that there are \(\frac{5!}{2! 3!} = 10\) permutations of \(EIEII\text{,}\) and so there are also 10 combinations.</p>
