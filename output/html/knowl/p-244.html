<p>Definitions are very important in mathematics to facilitate clear communication of ideas. However, it is an unfortunate fact that it is impossible to define every concept. Recall that a set is defined as a “collection of distinct objects”. This naturally leads to the question of how a collection is defined. After all, “set” and “collection” seem to be almost synonyms, so defining one in terms of the other seems unhelpful. Theoretically, we could define “collection”, say as an group or aggregate of things. This isn't much more helpful, since now we would have to define a group or aggregate. This could continue indefinitely, until we run out of suitable words. In this way, a concept like a set is simply defined intuitively.</p>
