<p>By contradiction, suppose \(n &gt; k\) objects are placed into \(k\) boxes, and each box contains at most one object. Then, the total number of objects, \(n\text{,}\) is equal to the sum of the objects in each of the \(k\) boxes. Then, the sum of the objects in the \(k\) boxes is at most \(k \cdot 1 = k\text{,}\) because there is at most one object in each box. This implies that \(n \leq k\text{,}\) which contradicts the assumption that \(n &gt; k\text{.}\)</p>
<p>By contradiction, suppose \(n \lt k\) objects are placed into \(k\) boxes, and no box is empty, that is, every box has at least one object. Then, the number of objects \(n\) is equal to the sum of the objects in each of the \(k\) boxes, which is at least \(k \cdot 1 = k\text{,}\) because each box contains at least one object. Thus, \(n \geq k\text{,}\) contradicting the assumption that \(n \lt k\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-TPP.html#proof-74">in-context</a></span>
